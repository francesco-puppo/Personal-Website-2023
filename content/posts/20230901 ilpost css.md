Since I spend a lot of time reading the (incredibly always interesting) articles written by the team over at [ilpost.it](https://ilpost.it), I took the time to review and clean up some CSS style I wrote to customise the article view.

While on Safari I always use the reader mode (which is not customisable in any way), while on other browsers I had to rely on the, often lacking, alternatives.

The goal was to create a cleaner way to read articles, focusing on the text and reducing distractions.

- Hidden all distracting elements
- Changed fonts to Noto
- Increased the font-size for readibility reasons
- Reduced the size of the audio player
- Reduced the impact of the comments button and the suggested articles
