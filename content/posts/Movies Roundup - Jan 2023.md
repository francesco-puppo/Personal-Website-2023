#### The Crime of the Century
★★★★

The kind of documentaries that is needed in our society. Even if you think you know enough about the opioid epidemic that has scourged the US for the last 20 years, give it a chance anyway because things are even more grim than you may think.

#### Undercurrent: The Disappearance of Kim Wall
★★★½

A chilling story which you should not watch on a rainy afternoon while cuddling on the couch with your partner, given how sad and tragic it is.

#### Triangle of Sadness
★★★★½ (rewatch)

Even on a second rewatch I still enjoyed this a lot (maybe even more than the first time) but I am still not convinced about the last part.
