The rough animal sketches of italian comic books artist Andrea Pazienza.

> Pazienza developed a personal body of work, alternating between playful comic cartooning—at times politically charged–and much more elaborate, dark, disturbing graphic novels, often dealing with drugs and wanton violence, with a scattering of black humor throughout.[^1]
