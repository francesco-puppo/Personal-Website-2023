I hate how it swaps movie’s covers.

I hate how it moves the Continue Watching row around.

I hate how it randomises the order of my Wish List.

I hate how it does this not because it’s better for me, the user, but because it’s better for them, the corporation. 

**Lastly, I profoundly hate that this is all UX is about nowadays.**
