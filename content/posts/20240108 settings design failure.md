*Because sometimes you don't need to choose*

---

There's a common idea in the product design world that settings and preferences are a design failure; they shouldn't be needed because the app should anticipate the user needs and not need any additional tweaking.

Anyway, while designing, it's common to ask yourself questions like "What if the user prefers to see this information in another way?" or "What if they want to hide or ignore some things?". 

Thanks to user research, you can often answer these questions, but when you can't you have to value by yourself: how much benefit would this feature *actually* bring to most users? Is it *really* needed, or are we just over-complicating things? 

To maximise the user experience, it's important to **don't add new stuff for the sake of it**, therefore keeping the number of options to a minimum. A preferences panel is not an excuse to drop in there anything you don't want to take a decision on.

Really good apps have a **small preferences panel**, displaying only those settings where the designer didn't have a strong enough opinion about and are there only to allow users to personalise the app to fit their needs, without impacting the overall workflow or experience.
