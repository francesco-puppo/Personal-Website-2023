I recently found out about [this concept](https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/our-thinking/maximum-viable-product) which explains perfectly what I think a great product should represent.
Both in my daily job and when using my devices for personal tasks, I found myself 

> We can define the Maximum Viable Product (Max VP) as a product that has just those features that allow it to *be successful and no more*. Customer needs are being met.

Instead of infinite grow (a concept at this point engrained in Silicon Valley companies) and the continuous adding of new features, a MaxVP is a finely tuned engine that runs at full speed, where every feature has been carefully implemented and the UX is king.

> There is a point where the feature set we have meets our customers desired outcomes, our Max VP. Where *adding more features begins to have a detrimental effect* on the user experience.

Some apps that I use every day come to mind:
- Things 3
- iA Writer
- Bear

These apps donâ€™t follow user requests but instead *anticipate* their needs and are *opinionated* in their design decisions.
