## Notes

### Email
Not much to say here. I neither write nor receive enough emails to justify anything more powerful than the default **[Mail](https://support.apple.com/mail)** app.

### Browser
Once you get used to it, moving away from **[Arc](https://arc.net/)** (on macOS) becomes really difficult. It’s also really interesting to follow closely such an active team, that comes up with new releases every few weeks (or maybe even more often). **[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)** is still my default on iPhone and iPad and sometimes I open it up on my MacBook as well. 

### Task manager
**[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)** is probably my favourite app in the world and I use **[Reminders](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841)** only for some shared lists.  I tried to make the switch and move everything there but it didn’t work. There’s just an abyss that separates the two. For work related tasks and documentation, everything is in **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)** since that’s what we use. 

### Bookmarks
Even if it’s not for everyone, I love almost everything about **[mymind](https://mymind.com/)**. Sure, their app could be improved a bit but the simplicity of just throwing everything in there and being sure you’ll find it again is priceless[^1]. Whenever I let my subscription expire, I regret it shortly after. Also, amazing approach at privacy and principles in general. 

### Photo shooting
For some reason I renewed **[Halide](https://halide.cam/)** but the reality is that the default **[Camera](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/camera-basics-iph263472f78/ios)** app covers 99% of my needs. I still enjoy using **[Spectre](https://spectre.cam/)** for long exposures, especially when crowds are involved.  

### Photo editing
I’ve been using **[Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/)** for so many years that I don’t even want to think about moving somewhere else, honestly. That being said, next year I want to try a cheaper solution (still need to figure out what that might look like).

### Notes
Apple **[Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109)** serves me perfectly well for my personal notes and, since it’s made by Apple, it integrates greatly with all my devices and offers good enough sharing features. Because I don’t want to mix research, personal, and work stuff, I use **[Bear](https://bear.app/)** for my research notes and **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)** (with my company account) for work related ones. 

### Writing
If you want to write for real, focus deeply, and lose yourself in your world there is simply nothing better than **[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)**.

## Design
I'm so happy **[Figma](https://figma.com/)** exists. The first thing I did when I started at Greenflux was to move all of our designs in there to allow better communication with other teams and hand-over to the developers. Sometimes, for quick personal stuff, I use **[Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)**, which is a great Photoshop replacement.

## Screenshots
**[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)** makes it a breeze to grab screenshots, record videos or gifts, and quickly edit them before sharing them. Amazing.

### Read later
My requirements in this regards are just those of having a nice place where to store files for later. **[GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app/)** is a beautiful and extremely polished native app for iOS that costs only a few bucks once. Do you *really* need more than that? [^2]

### Password manager
As [Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/app-defaults) said "**1Password**, like a sane person".

### Music
I grew sick of how Spotify kept changing their UI and suggesting me stuff I wasn’t interested in so I tried **[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/browse)**. Here I rediscovered the *old way* of listening to music: much more focused on albums, which is closer to how I organise music in my mind. 

### Messaging
I live in Europe so there really isn’t any alternative to **[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)** here...

### Sport
I’m so happy with my **[Suunto 9 Peak Pro](https://www.suunto.com/en-nl/Products/sports-watches/suunto-9-peak-pro/suunto-9-peak-pro-titanium-slate/)** that I’ll probably write something just about that. The app that comes with it is also much better than Garmin’s. That, paired with **[Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com/en/)** (which is the only app that keeps me on track with my exercises), is everything I need. 

[^1]: As it comes out, it actually has a well defined and pretty high price
[^2]: OK, maybe highlights, but they're supposed to be released at some point...
