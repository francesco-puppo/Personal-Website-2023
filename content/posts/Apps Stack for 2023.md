As you will see, the one below is a pretty opinionated list. 

I avoid apps  that try to do a thousand different things and end up doing all of them in a bad way. I much prefer simple apps that have great UX, beautiful UI, and a clear set of features.

I also try to follow the concept of [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/) when selecting which apps to use and I try to focus on what I *really* need from them.

### Default apps when they're enough

Apple default apps like  **Calendar**, **Mail**, **Notes**, **Finder/Files** and **Safari** do what I *really* need them to do, simple as that. 

Apple Notes wins, in this case, over Bear and other similar apps thanks to its integration within Apple ecosystem but also because of how it manages attachments, images, and handwritten notes.

### Things 3 to manage my personal life

[Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) integrates the GTD principles in a really easy to use way and it’s a pleasure to use. 

I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).

### NotePlan for work related tasks and notes

My [BuJo](https://bulletjournal.com) kind of workflow fits perfectly with how [NotePlan](https://noteplan.co) works and I love having everything in one place.

### Bear for research stuff

I could use Apple Notes or NotePlan for this, but I like to keep things separate. Also, [Bear](https://bear.app) is such a pleasure to use that I want a reason to keep opening it. 

I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).

### iA Writer for long form writing

Similar as above, I could write in Bear or another one of the apps I am already using, but none hold up with [iA Writer's](https://ia.net/writer) pure-writing experience. It’s only app that I can open and just start writing without losing focus for *hours*. 

I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).

### mymind as a second brain

It’s such a pleasure to have a place where you know you can throw anything you want to make sure you can find again later. The [mymind](https://mymind.com) apps keeps improving and I am happy supporting them since I deeply agree with their principles.

### Raycast as Spotlight replacement
It’s just unbelievable how powerful [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) is. Run shortcuts, write commands, or launch extensions from the store: the limit of stuff you can do with it gets pushed further away with every release.

### GoodLinks as a read-later list and Reeder 5 for RSS feeds

I used to have both combined in [Reeder 5](https://www.reederapp.com) but not being able to manage items in bulk really annoyed me.

[GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app/) is clean, reliable, and doesn't require a subscription.

### Spotify for music and Endel for focus sounds

[Endel](https://endel.io) provides an always-ready never-ending soundscape waiting for you for every scenario is a bliss. It really helps me focus when I need to (way more than just putting on some albums or playlist on [Spotify](http://spotify.com)).

### CleanShot X to capture and annotate stuff on my screen

[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) allows you to capture and annotate screenshots, grab videos, and upload them to the cloud before sharing online. And it's nicely integrated in the OS.

### Lightroom, Figma, Procreate, etc.

I use [Lightroom](http://lightroom.adobe.com) to organise and edit photos I shoot with my mirrorless camera, [Figma](http://figma.com) to design almost anything I need, [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) and [Fresco](https://www.adobe.com/products/fresco.html) to draw on the iPad, and [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) to replace Photoshop on my MacBook.
