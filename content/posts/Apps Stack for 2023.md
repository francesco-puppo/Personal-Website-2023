As you will see, the one below is a pretty opinionated list. 

I avoid apps  that try to do a thousand different things and end up doing all of them in a bad way. I much prefer simple apps that have great UX, beautiful UI, and a clear set of features.

I also try to follow the concept of [Max VP] when selecting which apps to use and I try to focus on what I *really* need from them.

- Apple default apps like  **Calendar**, **Mail**, **Notes**, **Finder/Files** and **Safari**: They do what I *really* need them to do, simple as that. Apple Notes wins, in this case, over Bear and other similar apps thanks to its integration within Apple ecosystem but also because of how it manages attachments, images, and handwritten notes.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) to manage my personal life: It integrates the GTD principles in a really easy to use way and it’s a pleasure to use. I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).
- [NotePlan](https://noteplan.co) for work related tasks and notes: My [BuJo](https://bulletjournal.com) kind of workflow fits perfectly with this app and I love having everything in one place.
- [Bear](https://bear.app) for research: I could use Apple Notes or NotePlan for this, but I like to keep things separate. Also, Bear is such a pleasure to use that I want a reason to keep opening it. I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for long form writing: Similar as above, I could write in Bear or another one of the apps I am already using, but none hold up with iA Writer’s pure-writing experience. It’s only app that I can open and just start writing without losing focus for *hours*. I consider this a [Max VP](/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/).
- [mymind](https://mymind.com) as a second brain: It’s such a pleasure to have a place where you know you can throw anything you want to make sure you can find again later. The apps keep improving and I am happy supporting them since I deeply agree with their principles. 
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) as a substitute for Spotlight: It’s just unbelievable how powerful this is. Run shortcuts, write commands, or launch extensions from the store: the limit of stuff you can do with it gets pushed further away with every release.
- [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app/) as a read-later list and [Reeder 5](https://www.reederapp.com) for RSS: I used to have both combined in Reeder 5 but not being able to manage items in bulk really annoyed me.
- [Spotify](http://spotify.com) for music and [Endel](https://endel.io) for focus sounds: Having an always-ready never-ending soundscape waiting for you for every scenario is a bliss. It really helps me focus when I need to (way more than just putting on some albums or playlist).
- [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) to annotate and review stuff I write using the iPad and Apple Pencil.
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) to capture and annotate screenshots, grab videos, and upload them to the cloud before sharing them with my colleagues.
- [Lightroom](http://lightroom.adobe.com) to organise and edit photos I shoot with my mirrorless camera, [Figma](http://figma.com) to design almost anything I need, [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) and [Fresco](https://www.adobe.com/products/fresco.html) to draw on the iPad, and [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) to replace Photoshop on my MacBook.
