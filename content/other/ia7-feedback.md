# iA Writer 7: Feedback

Hello,

First of all, congratulations for the release this new chapter in the life of such an amazing app.  I love the reasoning behind iA Writer 7, and the articles leading up to its release. Still, I have to say that I was hoping to see something more. 

I'm talking about small improvements here and there, even not related to AI, like a new Library experience, improved hashtags, or better wiki links. Anyway, while I still hope these will happen, they are not the subject here, so let's get back to the subject at hand.

One of the things I love about your app is the focus it forces into its user by limiting options and, in particular, removing *friction*. 

The best example is that, by default, the app starts with an empty page so you can immediately start writing without having to worry about anything.

Making “copying and pasting text from ChatGPT” the default flow when working with AI, instead, *adds* friction.

The easiest solution would be, of course, to integrate ChatGPT directly into the editor, but I can imagine how difficult it is do so in an app that revolves so much around minimalism and simplicity. 

As you pointed out, just slapping AI into your tool doesn’t add anything new compared to what everyone else is doing, so I tried to imagine something a bit different.

## Option 1: Limited integration 

After some thought I came up with this possible solution, which is inspired by [this article](https://maggieappleton.com/lm-sketchbook) from Maggie Appleton: [^1]

- “Hide” ChatGPT integration as with every other element in the interface. Only users that have enabled it should be able to place it around, same as with the other tools available now. 
- Limit its use around a set of specific tasks to guide users towards a *correct* use of AI. Some ideas could be:
	- Critique, to receive a different opinion about the text
	- Rephrase, to ask ChatGPT to provide a different version of the same text
	- Find evidence, to provide links to various sources that confirm what's been written [^2]
	- Grammar check, to analyse the text only from a grammatical point of view 
	- Give ideas, to receive back some prompts on how to move forward with the text
	- Ask a question, to be interrogated about the content of the page
- These could be set up and customised in the preferences, allowing users to come up with their own set of bots to assist them in their writing 

Of course this is a slippery slope: iA Writer could still mark the new content as generated by AI, but it might anyway change the behaviour of your users in a direction you’re not happy with. 

In that case maybe adding friction is actually the right choice, which brings us to the second option.

## Option 2: Assistant mode 

Another idea (a bit crazy but intriguing) is to create an integration where users can summon ChatGPT and select a series of predefined commands **but** they are not able to copy and paste anything from it. [^3]

AI, in this case, is used only in an *assistant mode*, let’s say. 

This way the AI assistant really becomes your personalised helper, that appears using a small modal on the side, and can be summoned either from the bar or by right-clicking on some text. 

I think that this option, even if radical, better suits with how you built the app over the years, and I know I would use it a lot.

Before concluding with some visual examples, let me just say that these are (obviously) incomplete ideas and I know that there a lot more things to take into consideration. Hopefully, anyway, these ideas might be of some help to you. 

## Examples

The new AI assistant button can be found in the toolbar (bottom right).

![Inactive](<../../images/2023-11-30 ia7 01 inactive.png>)

Once summoned, the AI assistant has a stark contrast compared to the rest of the UI, to clearly separate the action of using AI vs the one of writing.

Users can either ask for something specific by writing themselves, or they can select one of the predefined actions.

Even if I know you guys hate buttons I couldn't find another way to implement this.

![Critique tooltip](<../../images/2023-11-30 ia7 03 critique.png>)

The AI provides the answer, for the whole page in this case, and a small icon shows the action that was selected (Critique in this case).

![Reply](<../../images/2023-11-30 ia7 04 reply.png>)

The AI assistant also works on selected bits of text, to provide  more granular control over what the user wants to be analysed.

That's it! I would appreciate any kind of feedback but I also understand if you're too busy for that.

Congratulations again on such an amazing product.

[^1]: This is assuming that users have a subscription to ChatGPT and enable it in the preferences
[^2]: I have to say that I have some doubts regarding the ethical implications of this one
[^3]: Someone might find a workaround to allow this, but the basic idea is to increase friction in using AI to edit your text, thus forcing you in using it more as something to discuss with.
